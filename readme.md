# Advent of code 2018 solution

Like every year I try myself out on the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2018). This is my repo for the code I write to solve the different challenge. Might not be the best or cleanest but I try to do my best. Dont look at this repo is you hope to find the fastest solution of them all since I take my time to solve the puzzle and do not attempt to be in the top of the leader board.

You can find explanation of my solution in each of the day's folder. I'll try to detail them the most I can but I also try to have my code as clear as possible to make it readable by most people

My chosen language for this year is Powershell 5.1 as it's the current language I use the most at work. When the puzzle fits the need I will try to design my solution in [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
